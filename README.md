# Kodtest Edument

A webbapplication for browsing an made up directory

## What can this system do?

* Visualization of file tree in two ways:
  * Tree view
  * Icon view
* The visualization "Icon View" is accompanied by icons for:
  * Folders
  * Pictures:
    * jpg
    * png
  * Movies:
    * mp4
* Folders can be navigated up:
  * One level for icon view
  * Multiple levels for "Tree view"
* It is clear where you are in the file structure:
  * Icon view:
    * An area in the top saying "Your current location".
  * Tree view: evident by indentation.
* In "TreeView", please note that the current location means going up
